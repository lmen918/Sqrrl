# Sqrrl
A neat app to help us remember release dates and detail for the super cool things we look forward to.

# History of the app idea
The idea for this application was not my own originally. The idea was presented by a professor of mine.
I found myself thinking of how I his idea for this app was a reality. In short, I decided to bring
his idea to life in this format. 

The idea of this app is that we all find neat things online or through other means and we end up 
losing the details about those anticipated things. Wouldn't it be nice if we can log those things 
and have them automatically sync them with our calendar and get auto reminders?

That's where Sqrrl comes into play. When we find these neat things, Sqrrl is any easy way to set these
items as a reminder on your calendar with added features for saving details to help remind us of why
we thought the neat thing was so...well neat. 

The name Sqrrl was also my professor's idea. He thought of it as squirreling away release dates for
neat movies and shows and coming back to them later. I am expanding on the content idea that can be 
squirrled away from movies and shows to anything we find.
